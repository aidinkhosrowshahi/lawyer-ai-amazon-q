# CORS Issue Analysis and Solution

## Current Issue
The web application is receiving a CORS error when trying to access the `/execution-status/case` endpoint:
```
Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://jgnakenb5m.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/execution-status/case
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The 403 status code with missing CORS headers indicates that the request is being rejected by API Gateway before reaching any Lambda function
2. Looking at the workspace files:
   - The API Gateway has CORS configured correctly in template.yaml
   - The Lambda functions have proper CORS headers in their responses
   - The `/execution-status/case` endpoint is not defined in the template.yaml

## Solution
To resolve this issue, you need to:

1. Check if the `/execution-status/case` endpoint is the correct endpoint you're trying to reach. If not, update the frontend code to use the correct endpoint.

2. If this is the intended endpoint, you need to add it to the API Gateway configuration in template.yaml. Add a new route under the API Gateway definition:

```yaml
  ApiGatewayApi:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Api
    Properties:
      StageName: !Ref Stage
      Cors:
        AllowMethods: "GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS"
        AllowHeaders: "Content-Type,X-Amz-Date,Authorization,X-Api-Key,X-Amz-Security-Token"
        AllowOrigin: "*"

  # Add the Lambda function for the new endpoint
  GetExecutionStatusFunction:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      CodeUri: src/
      Handler: your_handler_file.lambda_handler
      Events:
        GetExecutionStatus:
          Type: Api
          Properties:
            RestApiId: !Ref ApiGatewayApi
            Path: /execution-status/case
            Method: GET
```

3. Create the corresponding Lambda function with proper CORS headers in its response.

4. Deploy the updated SAM template to apply the changes.

This will ensure that:
- The endpoint exists in API Gateway
- CORS is properly configured
- The Lambda function handles the request with appropriate CORS headers

## Additional Note
If this endpoint is supposed to map to an existing Lambda function, you may just need to add the API Gateway event mapping to the existing function in template.yaml rather than creating a new function.
