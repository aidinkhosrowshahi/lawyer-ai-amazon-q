## API Gateway Endpoint Status

Based on review of the SAM template (template.yaml), there is currently **no API Gateway endpoint** configured for the `GetStepFunctionStatusFunction`. 

While the template does define an API Gateway (ApiGatewayApi resource) and some functions do have API endpoints (like the CaseManagementFunction), the GetStepFunctionStatusFunction is missing API event configuration.

To add an API endpoint, you would need to add an Events section to the GetStepFunctionStatusFunction similar to how it's done for other functions. For example:

```yaml
GetStepFunctionStatusFunction:
  Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
  Properties:
    # ... existing properties ...
    Events:
      GetStatus:
        Type: Api
        Properties:
          Path: /status
          Method: get
          RestApiId: !Ref ApiGatewayApi
```

This would create a GET endpoint at /status that invokes the GetStepFunctionStatusFunction.
